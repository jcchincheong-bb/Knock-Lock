# Preliminary BOM
This is a preliminary parts list. It does not account for all passives (resistors and capacitors) or connectors (wires, solder, pin headers, etc.). Some components are also subject to 
change as design process proceeds. Additionally, any parts that can be found within the University stockpile will be used from there instead of purchased.
